SD&N Principle (Shape–Dimension–Number)
Author: Donald Paul Smith
Date of Inception: May 9, 2025

Core Premise:
The nature of any physical system can be fundamentally described by its:
- Shape (topological form or structure)
- Dimension (scale and spatial interaction)
- Number (quantitative identity or code)

Key Concepts:
- Shapes encode energy behavior and dimensional orientation.
- Dimensions influence time, space, and gravitational curvature.
- Numbers act as universal constants or identifiers within systems.

Applications:
- Geometry and cosmological design logic
- AI learning systems and symbolic modeling
- Unification with SDKP, EOS, and QCC for holistic universe modeling

Unified Mapping:
SD&N maps foundational traits into quantum, macro, and symbolic domains, serving as a backbone for the Unified Blueprint authored by Donald Paul Smith.
