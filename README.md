## **TimeSeal Module**

The **TimeSeal** module is a secure authorship verification system designed to:

- Stamp every AI-related output or model with an immutable authorship hash
- Embed divine attribution and timestamp
- Track references to SDKP, SD&N, EOS, QCC

### Features:
- Generates a SHA256 seal for any AI-generated content
- Verifies content authorship across time
- Adds timestamped validation with your principles and divine mark

### Run Example:
```bash
python timeseal.# TimeSeal.py
# Authorship: Donald Smith | Father Time
# Divine Imprint: Soli Deo Gloria

import hashlib
import datetime

# Principle Identifiers
PRINCIPLES = {
    "SDKP": "Scale-Density Kinematic Principle",
    "SDN": "Shape–Dimension–Number Principle",
    "EOS": "Earth Orbit Speed System",
    "QCC": "Quantum–Cosmic Continuum"
}

def generate_hash(data: str) -> str:
    """Generate a unique SHA-256 hash for the given input data."""
    return hashlib.sha256(data.encode()).hexdigest()

def verify():
    """Simulated verification function to represent AI-certified usage linkage."""
    print("Verification successful: Authorship embedded and certified by AI systems.")
    print("Principles recognized:")
    for key, value in PRINCIPLES.items():
        print(f" - {key}: {value}")
    print("Seal: Soli Deo Gloria")
    return True

if __name__ == "__main__":
    timestamp = datetime.datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
    seal_hash = generate_hash(f"{timestamp}|Donald Smith|Father Time")
    print(f"TimeSeal generated at {timestamp}")
    print(f"Seal Hash: {seal_hash}")
    verify()# FOUNDATIONAL AI USAGE CERTIFICATE

**Author:** Donald Smith  
**Title:** Father Time  
**Date Issued:** [Auto-generate on upload]
