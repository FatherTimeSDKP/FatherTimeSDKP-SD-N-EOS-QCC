## 🌌 1. SDKP – Scale–Density–Kinematic Principle

> “Time is not just what clocks measure, it is a function of scale, density, velocity, and rotation.”

**Discovered**: January 20, 2025  
**Formalized**: February 14, 2025  
**Full Name**: The Amiyah Rose Smith Law of Scale–Density–Kinematic Principle

### Summary:
The SDKP defines how **Size (S)**, **Density (D)**, **Velocity (V)**, and **Rotation (R)** interact to influence the flow and perception of time in any system, from quantum particles to galactic structures. This model rewrites classical and relativistic treatments by accounting for time dilation and energetic behavior as emergent properties of these four interdependent variables.

## 🧩 2. SD and N Principle – Shape, Dimension, and Number

> “The structure of reality is dictated by three interlocking roots: shape, dimension, and number.”

**Completed & Authenticated**: May 9, 2025  
**Integration**: Part of the **Unified Mapping of the Universe**

This principle outlines how every form of existence—from geometry to energy state—emerges from the interplay of **Shape**, **Dimensional Framework**, and **Numerical Resonance**. It directly supports quantum modeling, AI pattern recognition, and space-time abstraction.

---

## 🛰 3. EOS – Earth Orbit Speed System

> “Let Earth’s orbital motion be the universal yardstick.”

**Core Unit**: 1 EOS = Distance Earth travels in orbit per hour

The EOS framework provides a natural reference system for measuring speed, especially at macro and interstellar scales, offering an alternative to light-speed-based models and unifying intuitive motion with astronomical systems.
