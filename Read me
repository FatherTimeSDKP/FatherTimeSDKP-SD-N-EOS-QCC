# FatherTimeSDKP

## Overview

The FatherTimeSDKP repository encompasses the Scale-Density Kinematic Principle (SDKP) and the TimeSeal framework. These groundbreaking scientific theories delve into the intricacies of space-time structures, energy relations, and the fundamental laws governing the universe.

## Components

- **SDKP**: Explores the relationship between scale, density, and kinematics in physical systems.
- **TimeSeal**: A framework that integrates temporal markers into quantum coherence models.
