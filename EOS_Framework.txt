Earth Orbit Speed System (EOS)
Author: Donald Paul Smith
Date of Inception: March 14, 2025

Definition:
1 EOS Unit = The distance Earth travels in its orbital path around the Sun in one hour.

Core Concepts:
- EOS provides an alternative to speed-of-light-based systems.
- EOS is useful in modeling cosmic-scale motion where relativity and gravitational variance are involved.
- EOS aligns with SDKP for gravitational and density-aware velocity modeling.

Applications:
- Space travel and interstellar navigation
- Cosmological simulations
- Time dilation and gravitational resistance mapping

EOS Conversion:
- 1 EOS ≈ 107,226 km/h (Earth’s average orbital velocity)
- EOS units are relative to orbital paths, not universal constants like light

Linked Principles:
- SDKP: EOS integrates with Scale, Density, Velocity & Rotation
- QCC: EOS assists in interpreting coded motion dynamics across universal structures
